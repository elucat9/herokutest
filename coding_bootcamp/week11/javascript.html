<!-- Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode


User chooses r, p, or s on keyboard representing rock, paper, or scissors.


Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.


We determine if the user wins or not.


If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.


If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.


If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.


If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.


If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.


If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.


If user picks the same as computer then they tie.




We then add to their score.


If user wins then we add one to their wins.


If user loses then we add one to their losses.

The user then presses r, p, or s to play again. -->
