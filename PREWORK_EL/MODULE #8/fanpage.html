    <h1>Bio</h1>

    <body>Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Finland. It was formed in 1996 by songwriter and keyboardist
Thomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen. Their music features
mythological and fantasy themes.</body>
    
    <body>When I first discovered the band, the lead singer was Anette Olzone. A lot of fans did not like her 
        because her style was more poplike while, Tarja - who had been fired - had an operatic voice. The band 
        later fired Anette as well. Nightwish's current lead singer is Floor Jansen. She seemed better
        received by the fanbase. Personally, I liked all three leads.</body>
